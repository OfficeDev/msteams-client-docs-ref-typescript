name: AppId
uid: '@microsoft/teams-js.AppId'
package: '@microsoft/teams-js'
summary: >-
  A strongly-typed class used to represent a "valid" app id.


  Valid is a relative term, in this case. Truly valid app ids are UUIDs as
  documented in the schema:

  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema#id

  However, there are some older internal/hard-coded apps which violate this
  schema and use names like

  com.microsoft.teamspace.tab.youtube. For compatibility with these legacy apps,
  we unfortunately cannot

  securely and completely validate app ids as UUIDs. Based on this, the
  validation is limited to checking

  for script tags, length, and non-printable characters.
