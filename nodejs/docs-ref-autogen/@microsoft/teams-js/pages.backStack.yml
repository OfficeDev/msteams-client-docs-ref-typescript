      Registers a handler for user presses of the host client's back button.
      Experiences that maintain an internal

      navigation stack should use this handler to navigate the user back within
      their frame. If an application finds

      that after running its back button handler it cannot handle the event it
      should call the navigateBack

      method to ask the host client to handle it instead.
