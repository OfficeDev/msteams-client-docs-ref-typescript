summary: >-
  RenderingSurfaces describes the context or surface in which your app is being
  displayed within the host application.

  This parameter allows your app to detect where it is rendered (for example, in
  a side panel or stage view)

  and adjust its behavior or UI accordingly. The intent is to help developers
  understand the user's context of use,

  not the exact pixel size or layout. If a host (such as Outlook Meeting Apps)
  changes the size of a surface (e.g., makes the side panel larger),

  it will still use the same RenderingSurface value. Developers are expected to
  use responsive UI techniques to adapt to size changes,

  since the user's context and intent remain the same even if the surface
  dimensions change.
