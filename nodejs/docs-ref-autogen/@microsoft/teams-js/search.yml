  Allows your application to interact with the host M365 application's search

  This functionality is in Beta.

      Allows the caller to register for various events fired by the host search
      experience.

      Calling this function indicates that your application intends to plug into
      the host's search box and handle search events,

      when the user is actively using your page/tab.


      The host may visually update its search box, e.g. with the name or icon of
      your application.


      Your application should *not* re-render inside of these callbacks, there
      may be a large number

      of onChangeHandler calls if the user is typing rapidly in the search box.


      **Example**


      ``` ts

      search.registerHandlers(
          query => {
              console.log('Update your application to handle the search experience being closed. Last query: ${query.searchTerm}');
          },
          query => {
              console.log(`Update your application to handle an executed search result: ${query.searchTerm}`);
          },
          query => {
              console.log(`Update your application with the changed search query: ${query.searchTerm}`);
          },
       );
      ```

            This handler will be called when the user exits or cancels their
            search.

            Should be used to return your application to its most recent,
            non-search state. The value of
            [searchTerm](xref:@microsoft/teams-js.search.SearchQuery.searchTerm)

            will be whatever the last query was before ending search.

            The handler will be called when the user executes their

            search (by pressing Enter for example). Should be used to display
            the full list of search results.

            The value of
            [searchTerm](xref:@microsoft/teams-js.search.SearchQuery.searchTerm)
            is the complete query the user entered in the search box.

            This optional handler will be called when the user first starts
            using the

            host's search box and as the user types their query. Can be used to
            put your application into a

            word-wheeling state or to display suggestions as the user is typing.


            This handler will be called with an empty
            [searchTerm](xref:@microsoft/teams-js.search.SearchQuery.searchTerm)
            when search is beginning, and subsequently,

            with the current contents of the search box.
