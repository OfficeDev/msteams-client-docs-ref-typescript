summary: >-
  This group of capabilities enables apps to show modal dialogs. There are two
  primary types of dialogs: URL-based dialogs and [Adaptive
  Card](https://learn.microsoft.com/adaptive-cards/) dialogs.

  Both types of dialogs are shown on top of your app, preventing interaction
  with your app while they are displayed.

  - URL-based dialogs allow you to specify a URL from which the contents will be
  shown inside the dialog.
    - For URL dialogs, use the functions and interfaces in the [url](xref:@microsoft/teams-js.dialog.url) namespace.
  - Adaptive Card-based dialogs allow you to provide JSON describing an Adaptive
  Card that will be shown inside the dialog.
    - For Adaptive Card dialogs, use the functions and interfaces in the [adaptiveCard](xref:@microsoft/teams-js.dialog.adaptiveCard) namespace.
