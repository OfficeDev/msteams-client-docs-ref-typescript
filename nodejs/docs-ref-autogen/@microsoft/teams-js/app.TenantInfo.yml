    summary: >-
      The Azure AD tenant ID of the current user.


      Because a malicious party can run your content in a browser, this value
      should

      be used only as a optimization hint as to who the user is and never as
      proof of identity.

      Specifically, this value should never be used to determine if a user is
      authorized to access

      a resource; access tokens should be used for that.

      See [getAuthToken](xref:@microsoft/teams-js.authentication.getAuthToken_1)
      and [authenticate](xref:@microsoft/teams-js.authentication.authenticate_1)
      for more information on access tokens.
