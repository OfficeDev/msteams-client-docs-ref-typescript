summary: >-
  Synchronizes the underlying state of an ephemeral object with all of the other
  instances of

  the object connected to the same container.
fullName: EphemeralObjectSynchronizer<TState>
remarks: >-
  When a synchronizer for a ephemeral object is first created it will broadcast
  a `"connect"`

  message, containing the objects initial state, to all other instances of the
  object that are

  currently running on other clients. Those instances will respond to the sent
  "connect" message

  by broadcasting an `"update"` message containing the current state of their
  object.


  Anytime a remote "connect" or "update" event is received, the synchronizer
  will call the passed

  in `updateState` callback with the remote objects state and the senders
  clientId for role

  verification purposes. The logic for processing these state updates will vary
  but implementations

  will generally want to include a timestamp in their state update so that
  clients can protect

  against out-of-order and delayed updates. Deriving your state update from
  `IEphemeralEvent` and

  using `EphemeralEvent.isNewer` to compare the received update with the current
  update makes this

  simple.


  Once the initial "connect" event is sent, the synchronizer will periodically
  broadcast additional

  "update" events containing the ephemeral objects current state. This
  redundancy helps to guard

  against missed events and can be used as a ping for scenarios like presence
  where users can

  disconnect from the container without notice.  The rate at which these ping
  events are sent can be

  adjusted globally by setting the static
  `EphemeralObjectSynchronizer.updateInterval` property.


  While each new synchronizer instance will result in a separate "connect"
  message being sent, the

  periodic updates that are sent get batched together into a single "update"
  message. This lets apps

  add as many ephemeral objects to a container as they'd like without increasing
  the number of

  messages being broadcast to the container.


  Only a single synchronizer is allowed per ephemeral object. Attempting to
  create more than one

  synchronizer for the same ephemeral object will result in an exception being
  raised.
