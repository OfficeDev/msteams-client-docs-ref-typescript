  The `beforeTurn` event is triggered before the turn is processed. This allows
  for the turn state to be

  modified before the turn is processed. Returning false from the event handler
  will prevent the turn from

  being processed.


  The `afterTurn` event is triggered after the turn is processed. This allows
  for the turn state to be

  modified or inspected after the turn is processed. Returning false from the
  event handler will prevent

  the turn state from being saved.
